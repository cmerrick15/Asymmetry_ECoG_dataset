function [ out ] = LPF( in, sr, cutoff, varargin )
% LPF: Simple low pass filter
% 
% Syntax:
% out = LPF(x,f,c), applies low-pass filter to input signal x, around the
% cutoff frequency c, where f is the sampling frequency. The default filter
% is a 4th-degree non-causal Butterworth filter. 
%
% out = LPF(x,f,c,d) defines d as the filter order (e.g. 2,3,8). 
%
% out = LPF(...,'causal') specifies a causal filter (see NOTE 1).
%
% out = LPF(...,'cheb',R) specifies a Chebyshev Type I filter rather than
% Butterworth. R is the peak-to-peak passband ripple amplitude, in dB. If
% ommited, the default value is 0.5 dB. 
%
% out - LPF(...,'butter') specifies a Butterworth filter. This is the
% default setting. 
% 
%
% NOTE 1: A Causal filter is one where the signal is filtered once in the
% forward direction, shifting the signal forward in relation to the
% original signal, but preserving its "causality", i.e., the value of each 
% data point is determined only by past data points. By contrast, in a 
% non-causal filter the signal is zero-shifted preserving peak latencies,
% but at the expense of each point being the product of both past and 
% future time points, meaning that the onset of a waveform may appear
% earlier than it was in the non-filtered signal. 
% 
% NOTE 2: A non-causal (default) filter is implemented using Matlab's 
% filtfilt function, which filters the signal twice - once in every
% direction. This means that the attenuation at each frequency will be
% double (in dB) relative to the causal filter with the same parameters.
% For example, a 4nd Butterworth filter attenuates the signal by 3dB at the
% cutoff frequency and by 12 dB per octave (i.e. per each doubling of the
% cutoff frequency). However unless a causal filter is specified, the
% signal resulting from this function will be attenuated by 6 dB at the
% cutoff frequency and by 24 dB per octave.
